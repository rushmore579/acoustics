The original code just created one large square canvas.

However, for these sound panel arrays, I'm realizing that asymmetrical designs look better. Where there are maybe very few (1-2) panels on the left half and more (say 4-5) on the right half (like the one on the homepage at miruacoustics.com). 

So, I want to essentially put two (or more) of these 'mondrian generators' next to each other, or maybe even tile them, so the user can add constraints to the Left side, Right side, top, bottom, etc. 

As you can see I have figured out (however inelegantly) how to create a canvas that is landscape oriented. I've constrained the current generator to the left half. My plan was to have the .js re-run - with different parameters - again on the right half, but alas I'm just stumbling around since I don't officially know how to do any of this. 

Right now there are two main places where you can change what kind of design is generated (aside from the obvious like colors, line width, etc):
  - Line 10 of the .js: the 'step' size - the number of divisions will be some multiple of the denominator. It gets more interesting if the step size is something a little more off-kilter like step = [(size / 3) + 60], for example. 
  - line 27: the Math.random affects how many times squares are split (I think). 
  
  That's all for now.
