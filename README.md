# acoustics

This is similar to a number of sites and projects that are some version of a "Mondrian Generator," i.e., designed to generate a set of rectangles, squares and colors that resemble art by Piet Mondrian.

I found this on-line a while back but can't seem to find the original publisher so can't credit them unfortunately. However, it's the best Mondrian Generator I've seen.

Utimately, I'd like to use something like this to create designs for:
- groups of sound absorbing acoustic panels
- tile (kitchen, bathroom)
- anything else that comes to mind

Work in progress.
