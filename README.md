This is similar to a number of sites and projects that are some version of a "Mondrian Generator," i.e., designed to generate a set of rectangles, squares and colors that resemble art by Piet Mondrian.

I found this on-line a while back but can't seem to find the original publisher so can't credit them unfortunately. However, it's the best Mondrian Generator I've seen.

Work in progress.
